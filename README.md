# RemoteJobsPlattform
This project will revolutionize the remote job market !


This project was created to put all job portals in competition. We focus on the remote job market, which is changing rapidly due to the Corona pandemic. More and more companies are offering their services and jobs remotely in order to hire more creative minds and the best developers and IT professionals. Unfortunately, many companies do not provide sufficient information about remote options of their company or the job in the job posting. On the other hand, many potential new employees are questionably scrambling to find the right remote jobs. Many jobs are listed as remote on job portals, but are actually home office models. We would like to revolutionize the problem of incorrect information and the low remote functionality of job portals. 

Time to start the revolution in Europe. Let's go!
